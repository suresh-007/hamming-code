# hamming-code
1.when we sent the data through network we cannot blindly belive everybit is correctly sent.
2.Due to many disturbances the 0 can be changed to 1 or viceversa.
3.there are many processes to find whether the databits sent are correctly reaches or not.
4.Hamming code is one of them.
5.Hamming code is used to verify wheather the sent databits are all correctly transmitted 
  to the other end (received side)  using redundant bits.
6.redundant bits are bits that are added to original bits during transmission.
7.Based on the redundant bits only we are able to find the position of error in sent databits. 
8.Using hamming code we are able to find error in only one bit.
